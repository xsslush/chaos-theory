# Simulating Chaos with Python

This is a scientific and educational project developed by a student to explore the beauty and complexity of chaotic systems using Python. The focus is on the **logistic map**, a simple mathematical equation that reveals how chaos emerges from deterministic rules.

## What is this about?

The project investigates:

- The mathematical concept of **chaos**
- The behavior of the **logistic map**: \( x_{n+1} = r \cdot x_n \cdot (1 - x_n) \)
- How small changes in parameters can lead to **dramatically different outcomes**
- Beautiful visualizations that reveal patterns, bifurcations, and unpredictability

## Goals

- Build a Python simulation of the logistic map
- Create visualizations (bifurcation diagrams, time series, etc.)
- Understand the concepts of sensitivity to initial conditions and non-linearity
- Write a scientific article to share with students and teachers

## Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebooks (optional)

## How to run

1. Clone this repository:

2. Navigate into the project folder:

3. Install dependencies:
